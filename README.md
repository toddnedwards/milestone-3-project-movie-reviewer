## **Site Overview**

Movie Reviewers is an online application for movie fans and critiques to read post reviews of movies that they have watched to share with other people. Users can only see examples of the reviews until they login or register. Once logged in and registered, users can create, edit and delete their own reviews, as well search through reviews of other movies that they may have watched or want to watch and find an opinion on.

### **Color Scheme**

The color scheme has been mainly provided by Materialize CSS:
[Materialize CSS options](https://materializecss.com/color.html)

The main color schemes used are:

Navigation bar: black (provided by materialize CSS)<br>
Footer: black (provided by materialize CSS)<br>
Body background: #eceff1 (Hex color code, off white)<br>
H1 text when against background images (Home/index page and Reviews Page): amber-text text-lighten-2 (provided by materialize CSS)<br>
Review cards (Home/index page and Reviews Page): blue darken-1 (provided by materialize CSS)

The colours I chose we're to keep the design simple, but also similar colours used in cinemas, such as royal blue, gold and red which is provided by the main background image.<br>
[See background image here](static/images/background-image-cropped.jpg)

## ** Typography **

I decided to use the oswald font family from google as I had searched for different cinema fonts on google and this seemed to look the best and makes the text stand out well also against background images and colours. <br>
