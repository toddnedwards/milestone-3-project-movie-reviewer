## **Site Overview**

Movie Reviewers is an online application for movie fans and critiques to read post reviews of movies that they have watched to share with other people. Users can only see examples of the reviews until they login or register. Once logged in and registered, users can create, edit and delete their own reviews, as well search through reviews of other movies that they may have watched or want to watch and find an opinion on.
